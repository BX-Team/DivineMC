> [!WARNING]  
> DivineMC is a performance-oriented fork. Make sure to take backups **before** switching to it. We also welcome a new contributor to help us improve the fork.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- All worlds **are ticked in parallel**, so the server can take full advantage of multicore processors.
- **Implemented Secure Seed mod** that changes default 64-bit seed to a 1024-bit seed, making it almost impossible to crack the seed.
- **Native math functions** using a new Java 22 feature, calling C functions directly from Java.
- **Optimized chunk generation** that can generate chunks up to 70% faster than vanilla.
- **Async pathfinding and entity tracker**
- **Fully compatible** with Bukkit, Spigot and Paper plugins
- **Fixes** some Minecraft bugs
- and more...
