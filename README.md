## üì¶ Building and setting up
### Initial setup
First, clone this repository (do not download it) and the run the following command in the root directory:
```bash
./gradlew applyAllPatches
```
After that, project is ready to use and editing it.

### Creating a patch
Patches are effectively just commits in either `paper-api`, `paper-server`, `purpur-api`, `purpur-server` or `divinemc-server`. If you want to learn how to work with patch system, you can read our [contributing documentation](https://docs.bxteam.org/documentation/divinemc/development/contributing).

### Compiling
Use the command `./gradlew build` to build the API and server. Compiled JARs will be placed under `divinemc-api/build/libs` and `divinemc-server/build/libs`. **These JARs are not used to start a server**.

To compile a server-ready paperclip jar, run `./gradlew createMojmapPaperclipJar`. The compiled paperclip jar will be put in `divinemc-server/build/libs`.
